# watch.sideby.me Documentation

This directory documents how the watch.sideby.me app is structured and how to work on it **as it exists today**. Older root-level docs (under `../docs/`) are historical background and design notes; this directory is the source of truth for contributors working on this app.

## Contents

- Architecture and file layout
- Naming, style, patterns, and best practices
- Contribution and code review
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, errors, performance, UI copy)
- Local development, testing, deployment, and troubleshooting

See the individual guides in this folder for details.
